> Graph partioning is a one of the NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We can find many papers applying genetic algorithm to the graph partiioning problem.
> From the journal paper "Performance of a Genetic Algorithm for the Graph Partitioning Problem (2003)" written by K. Kohmoto et al., I think that the method suggested in the paper can be applied to our term project with two reasons below.
> First, it provides the description of the genetic algorithm and essential functions such as mutation operator, crossover operator and else on the graph partitioning.
> Second, it contains the experiment of basic level, which can be conducted by beginner level of graph partitioning problem, compared to other recent papers. I think it is important to consider the deadline of project which is 15. December.
> Moreover, I'm currently working on the topic related to graph so that it can be helpful to apply GA to my research someday.
> That's why I choose this topic and the paper as the reference, although the paper was published in 2003.
